# DApp Academy

The complete end-to-end guide on decentralized application development.

This course aims to guide you through the complete development of a decentralized application, from start to finish. We will start by building the Solidity smart contracts, testing and deploying with Truffle. Next we will move into JavaScript, communicating with our smart contracts with Web3 and generating our user interface using ReactJS. Finally we will wrap up by serving our front end through an IPFS node behind a custom domain name.

All though it's not required, It's a good idea to have touched on smart contract programming with Solidity and have a basic understanding of programming fundamentals with JavaScript before starting this course.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Setting up our environment
